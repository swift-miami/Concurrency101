#### General Advice:
* Avoid using concurrent queues at all cost.
    * Instead use a serial queue per sub system and use a target queue if you need subsystems to interact.
    * Reader/writer locks tend to be a source of great complexity and hard to get right, specially in Swift which is bad at atomic access. If needed itâ€™s better to use `os_unfair_lock`
* Combine helps handling concurrency with its stream of events API.
* Donâ€™t use GlobalQueues.
   * Quote from Swift Evolution: [Fixing race conditions in async/await example](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170828/039368.html): ` dispatch_get_global_queue() is in practice on of the worst thing that the dispatch API provides`
* Shouldnâ€™t need to specify QoS unless for example you start a process in the main queue and want it to go in the background specifically. Otherwise let the system determine the QoS for you.
